# Mini Hello World Example

This project was made as a mini "hello world" project that installs `docker` and runs a small `express` server on port `3000`.

To start it up, just run `run.sh` and enter the 'name' of the server. If you specify the name to be 'Test Server', it'll say 'Hello from Test Server!'.
